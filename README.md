Hospitals are our most vital facilities, but inefficient allocation of resources and workers often leads to bottlenecks that reduce the quality of care received by patients. 
However, this issue is not so easily solved by just having more resources, but rather, by how and when to administer said resources. This project aims to explore
the different ways in which the hospitals can create metrics to do this.
